# hazedb RFC

**Status:** M1–M6 implemented (store, SQL, WAL durability, UUIDv7 PK, partitioning, runtime catalog + `CREATE`/`DROP TABLE`, single-table transactions); M7–M8 open. See *Implementation status* for what is running vs designed.  
**Module:** `github.com/VeloxCoding/hazedb`  
**Updated:** 2026-06-12 (rev. 36 — `/meta` now reports `tombstones` per table + `total_tombstones`, surfacing that deleted rows are not reclaimed in a running process: the arena slot and the partitioned `tails` scan entry linger until a restart-from-checkpoint, so a heavy insert+delete workload grows scan cost + memory until then. rev. 35 — WAL replay validates DECODED records before applying them: an out-of-range UPDATE ordinal or a wrong-width INSERT row fails closed with `ErrWALCorrupt` instead of panicking inside `Open()`, mirroring the SQLite drain path's guard. rev. 34 — the parser bounds expression nesting (`maxExprDepth` = 256), closing a stack-overflow remote-kill DoS. rev. 33 — `MaxBytes` byte cap + `/meta` store stats: every insert reserves its byte cost against a store-wide budget and is rejected with `ErrCapacity` / HTTP 507 over the cap; the store never auto-evicts. rev. 32 — `walVersion` 1→2 and replay rejects ANY non-current version)

## What it is

hazedb is a **general-purpose embedded SQL database**, not a domain or
application-specific store. It happens to be memory-resident with a WAL for
durability, but the data model, query language, and features are generic —
tables, columns, a primary key, optional partitioning and indexes, SQL.

> **About the examples in this document.** Concrete tables like
> `messages(thread_id, seq, body)`, sessions, or leaderboards are *only

An embedded, memory-resident SQL store for single-process Go applications.
All reads come from RAM. Disk stores append-only WAL segments and log-derived snapshots — never table pages or a buffer pool. No network protocol, no separate
process, no buffer pool.

**Target:** latency-sensitive OLTP where the working set fits in RAM. Compile
it directly into a Caddy module, FrankenPHP extension, or standalone Go
binary. (Workloads like session state, hot leaderboards, or append-and-scan
tables are *examples* of that profile, not the scope.)

## Implementation status

The remainder of this RFC describes the **target architecture** — the full design hazedb is being built toward. Not all of it is implemented. This section is the single source of truth on what runs today vs what is planned.

### Running today (M1–M6)

- Sharded RWMutex storage: `[]Value` typed rows, append-only arena, tombstone deletes, per-shard `map[UUID]uint64` PK index, `uint64` rowID
- **UUIDv7 PK, enforced** — `[16]byte` stored inline in `Value` (no per-cell alloc); INSERT auto-generates a monotonic UUIDv7 when omitted (resolved before the WAL write), or accepts a client UUID; a canonical-string PK is parsed to UUID at the API boundary, never in storage
- Immutable order column (`seq`) support: an `Immutable` column flag rejects `UPDATE SET` at plan time (PK is implicitly immutable) — the stable schema M5's tail index builds against
- **Logical typed-mutation WAL**: versioned self-delimiting envelope (`magic|type|version|length|payload|crc32c`); MUTATION payload is `op|tableID|op-body` (insert=full row, update=pk+changed-column deltas, delete=pk); CRC32C; replay fails loud on bad magic / any non-current `walVersion` / unknown type / CRC mismatch on a complete record, tolerates truncated tails (a format change bumps `walVersion` so a pre-change WAL is rejected, never misparsed)
- WAL durability modes (M3): flush ticker (`WALFlushInterval`, 0=1s default, <0=manual), `WALSync` (ticker fsync via a `dirtySinceSync` flag), `WALSyncPerWrite`, sticky WAL error state
- Write pipeline enforces validate → WAL append → apply under the relevant shard lock(s); multi-shard predicate writes hold every shard lock so WAL order == in-memory order
- Runtime SQL engine (the hot path): `SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` with arithmetic in `SET` and `WHERE` (`col +/-/* ?`); plans cached per SQL string in a `sync.Map`, parsed once then reused. `INSERT` accepts multiple `VALUES` tuples; a multi-row insert commits atomically through the transaction path (one `recTxn` WAL envelope, each touched shard locked once), so a duplicate/invalid row anywhere fails the whole statement. This amortises per-row WAL overhead — decisively under `WALSyncPerWrite`, where the batch fsyncs once instead of per row. An atomic batch is capped at 1000 mutations (`maxTxnMutations`): it bounds shard-lock hold time and transient memory, keeps the count under the `recTxn` envelope's uint16, and costs no real throughput (the fsync amortisation is near-complete by ~1000 rows — split larger loads). Over the cap is a clean `ErrBatchTooLarge`, never a silent truncation
- PK fast path (`WHERE id = ?` → pk-map lookup, one shard) and indexed partition scan (`WHERE partkey = ?`), both as compiled-plan properties available to runtime-created tables
- **PartitionKey shard routing + table-wide `pkDirectory` + per-partition tail index** (M5) — partition-routed shards, `map[UUID]rowLocation` directory for table-wide PK uniqueness + O(1) `WHERE id = ?`, indexed `WHERE partkey = ?` scan
- **Runtime catalog + first-class DDL** — `CREATE TABLE` / `DROP TABLE` over an `atomic.Pointer[catalog]` (RCU swap), durable append-only table IDs, catalog-version plan invalidation, WAL-logged and replayed before mutations; runtime tables are not second-class (insert/read benchmarks identical to predeclared)
- *Measured benchmarks* were re-measured at rev. 12. Historical note: the M4 switch to a 16-byte UUID in every `Value` cell added ~10-22% ns / +50-100 B/op vs M3 (`bench/baseline_m4.txt`); an optional typed-struct wrapper could reclaim the `[]Value` overhead later (post-1.0, not on the hot path).
- Read-path clone-under-lock: a PK/partition lookup clones the matched row while still holding the shard read lock, so a returned row never aliases storage a concurrent write could mutate. A projected `SELECT` clones only its projected columns under the lock (no full-row clone), and a point-read `Query` evaluates just the PK argument from the raw args (no full `[]Value` conversion, no `evalCtx`) → ~198 ns / 4 allocs on a 3-col table projecting 2; `SELECT *` still takes the full-row clone
- `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` is applied during the scan (stop at the limit, project under the lock) instead of materialising the whole match set then truncating — fewer allocations and an early exit

- **Transactions (M6, v1 scope)** — `db.Transaction(func(tx *Tx) error)` closure; `tx.Exec` only (write-only API), PK-pinned statements, single table per tx; staged overlay for read-your-writes; arithmetic `SET` evaluated under the commit locks; poison-on-first-error; one `TXN` WAL envelope (atomic across crash, replayed all-or-nothing). Commit locks only the shards the transaction touches, ascending (deadlock-safe against the all-shard acquirers).

### Designed, not yet implemented

## Store foundation

### Sharded RWMutex over generic rows (typed generated structs planned)

```
shards = runtime.NumCPU() * 4   (floor 64, cap 1024, rounded to power-of-two)
```

The shard count is computed once at `Open()` and fixed for the process lifetime (power-of-two so routing is a mask, not a modulo). It is **runtime-derived, not persisted**: nothing shard-specific is written to the WAL or snapshot (both are logical — typed mutations / row dumps, never shard ids), so a WAL/snapshot written on a 32-core box (128 shards) replays correctly on an 8-core box (64 shards). Every row simply re-routes under the new count, and since PK lookups, `pkDirectory`, and tail indexes all derive placement from the same live count, the result is internally consistent — only the physical layout differs. The single hard requirement is that routing be identical for live writes, replay, and snapshot-load within one process; do not cache a routing result computed under a different count.

Two table shapes exist; shard routing and PK uniqueness enforcement differ between them.

**Non-partitioned table** (default — no `PartitionKey` declared):

```go
type tableShard struct {
    mu   sync.RWMutex
    rows []Row             // append-only arena; tombstones for deletes
    pk   map[UUID]uint64   // PK → rowID; shard determined by FNV-1a(PK)
    live int
}
```

PK uniqueness and `WHERE id = ?` are fully local to the shard — one lock, O(1).

> **Note:** the target keys this map by `UUID` (a fixed `[16]byte`), matching the partitioned `pkDirectory`'s `map[UUID]rowLocation`. A `[16]byte` is a comparable array usable as a map key with no allocation. The current M1+M2 code keys by `string` (integer/string PK, UUIDv7 not yet enforced — see *Implementation status*); that costs a string allocation + string hash per lookup and is inconsistent with the partitioned path. Switch to `map[UUID]uint64` when UUIDv7 enforcement lands (M3).

**Partitioned table** (`PartitionKey` declared):

```go
type tableShard struct {
    mu    sync.RWMutex
    rows  []Row                          // rows for ALL partition values that hash to this shard
    tails map[PartitionValue]*partitionIndex  // one ordered tail index per partition value
    live  int
}

// One pkDirectory per partitioned table — not per shard.
type pkDirectory struct {
    mu  sync.RWMutex
    idx map[UUID]rowLocation
}

type rowLocation struct {
    shard uint16
    rowID uint64
}
```

**A shard is not a partition value.** Routing is `FNV-1a(PartitionKey value) % shards`, and there are far fewer shards (64–1024) than distinct partition values, so multiple partition values necessarily collide into the same shard. The guarantee is one-directional: all rows for a *given* partition value land in *one* shard — but that shard's arena holds rows for every partition value that hashes to it. Therefore the ordered tail index **must be namespaced per partition value** (`map[PartitionValue]*partitionIndex` above), not a single per-shard index. A single per-shard index would interleave rows from unrelated partition values into one `seqs`/`rowIDs` order, so a tail scan for conversation P would return conversation Q's messages whenever P and Q collide. The rowIDs in each per-partition index still point into the shard's single shared arena (rowIDs are unique within the shard), so no `(shardID, rowID)` pairs are needed.

The per-shard `pk` map is absent for partitioned tables. PK uniqueness and `WHERE id = ?` go through the table-wide `pkDirectory`. INSERT: acquire pkDirectory lock → reject duplicate → acquire partition shard lock → write row → record location in pkDirectory → release both. `WHERE id = ?`: pkDirectory lookup → rowLocation → shard read. Two lock acquisitions instead of one; both O(1).

**Read-path TOCTOU — the shard read must re-validate liveness.** If the pkDirectory lock is released before the shard lock is taken (the concurrency-favouring choice), a concurrent `DELETE` can tombstone the row between the lookup and the read:

```
reader:  pkDirectory → {shard 5, rowID 100}, release pkDirectory lock
deleter: pkDirectory lock (remove entry); shard 5 lock (tombstone rowID 100)
reader:  shard 5 lock → reads rowID 100 → finds a tombstone
```

**Correction to an earlier draft (this was wrong before).** A previous revision said the read path should treat "rowLocation points at a tombstone / PK mismatch" as **not-found**. That is itself a bug. Consider a `DELETE` + `INSERT` of the *same* PK committed atomically in one transaction — exactly the PartitionKey-move pattern (`DELETE` + `INSERT` under a transaction, per *Immutability*). The transaction tombstones the old location, removes the old `pkDirectory` entry, writes the new row, and records the **new** location in the directory — all atomically. A reader that captured the *old* location before the transaction, then reads the shard after the transaction commits, sees a tombstone at the old rowID. Returning not-found is a phantom disappearance: the PK existed before the transaction and exists after it (at the new location); it was never absent. The row only "vanishes" because the reader is holding a stale location.

**The correct rule: on tombstone or PK-mismatch at the resolved location, re-do the `pkDirectory` lookup; do not return not-found from a stale location.** The retry observes the directory's current state: either the entry is gone (genuine delete → now correctly not-found) or it points to the new location (move → read the new row). Because rowIDs are append-only and never reused before a snapshot restart, there is no ABA hazard, so a single retry suffices in the common case; bound the retries to avoid a pathological move-storm loop. The alternative remains holding the `pkDirectory` read lock across the shard read — no TOCTOU at all, since the move (which needs the directory write lock for both the entry-removal and the entry-add) cannot interleave, but every point-read then serialises against every delete/move on that table. Pick one explicitly; the recommended default is release-then-**retry** (not release-then-return-not-found).

**The `pkDirectory` is not deferred.** Without it, two different partitions can hold the same UUID undetected (each shard sees no local duplicate), and `WHERE id = ?` has no deterministic shard to check. PartitionKey tables are semantically broken without a table-wide PK directory — it is a hard prerequisite, not an optimisation.

**Key design choices:**

- **PK is always UUIDv7** — see *Primary key* section above.
- **`[]Value` tagged union in memory** — no binary-encoded rows, no deserialization on the read path. A `Row` is `[]Value` where `Value` carries `Kind` (Null/Int/String/Bytes/Bool/UUID). `Value` is a **packed 32-byte tagged union** (down from 72): the kind-exclusive payloads overlap two `uint64` words plus one `unsafe.Pointer` — int/bool in a word, a UUID inline in the two words, a string/bytes backing pointer in the pointer (always nil or a real Go pointer, so the GC scans it). This roughly halves the resident dataset's memory and the bytes copied per read/scan; payloads are read through typed accessors (`Int`/`Str`/`Bytes`/`UUID`/`Bool`), so the layout stays private. An optional typed-struct wrapper (post-1.0) could copy a `Row` into a per-table Go struct for caller ergonomics, but the engine itself runs on `[]Value`.
- **Shard routing:**
  - **No `PartitionKey`** — shard by FNV-1a(PK). `WHERE id = ?` → one shard, one lock. Use for lookup-heavy tables (users, sessions).
  - **`PartitionKey` declared** — shard by FNV-1a(PartitionKey value). All rows for the same partition value land in one shard, but that shard also holds other partition values that hash to it, so the tail index is namespaced per partition value (`map[PartitionValue]*partitionIndex`) with rowIDs into the shard's shared arena. `WHERE id = ?` → pkDirectory → rowLocation → shard, two locks. Use for append/scan-heavy tables (messages, events, logs).
- **Immutability — enforced at plan time:**
  - The PK column (`id`) is never a valid target of `UPDATE SET` — rejected at plan time.
  - The `PartitionKey` column is never a valid target of `UPDATE SET` — rejected at plan time. Moving a row to a different partition requires `DELETE` + `INSERT` under a transaction.
  - **The tail-index order column is also immutable** on partitioned tables that declare one — rejected at plan time. The `partitionIndex` caches each row's order value in `seqs` parallel to `rowIDs`; an `UPDATE messages SET seq = ?` would change the row's stored value while leaving `seqs` stale, silently corrupting tail-scan order. If a mutable order column is ever required, the index must be maintained on update (find the entry, re-position it — an O(N) slice-shift, the same cost as an out-of-order insert), not just the row. v1 takes the simpler immutable-order-column route: the ordering value is set at insert and never changed; a new order requires `DELETE` + `INSERT`.
- **Tombstone on delete** — `rows[i] = nil`; for non-partitioned tables the local pk map entry is removed; for partitioned tables the pkDirectory entry is removed. RowIDs stay stable so the tail index does not need updating. The arena never shrinks — tombstone slots accumulate until snapshot restart (M7).
  - **Churn caveat (load-bearing for the stated use cases).** Two of the target workloads — session state and in-process caches — are high-eviction by nature. Because nothing reclaims tombstone slots before a snapshot/restart (M7, the *last* milestone), a delete-heavy table grows memory monotonically, and `partitionIndex` tail-scans with `LIMIT n` degrade over time: dead entries stay in the index (rowIDs are kept stable on delete), so a scan must skip accumulating tombstones to reach `n` live rows, turning an O(n) scan into O(n + tombstones). For insert+expire workloads this is unbounded growth and slowly rising tail latency between restarts. If those use cases are real targets, pull a minimal in-place arena/index compaction earlier than M7, or document the restart cadence required to bound memory.

### Lock ordering — global invariant

Every operation that acquires more than one lock must acquire them in this fixed order:

```
pkDirectory  (per partitioned table involved, ascending table index)
→ data shards  (lexicographic by (table index, shard index))
→ walMu
```

Violating this order causes deadlock. The canonical failure mode without this rule:

- regular partitioned write holds pkDirectory, waits for shard
- concurrent transaction holds shard, waits for pkDirectory → neither can proceed

The shard order is **lexicographic `(table index, shard index)`**, not shard index alone. Within a single table shard indices are unique, so for single-table operations (everything through M5) this reduces to plain ascending shard index. But the moment a transaction spans two tables that both have, say, shard index 3, "ascending shard index" is ambiguous: one transaction could grab `(A.3, B.3)` while another grabs `(B.3, A.3)` → deadlock. The table-index-first tie-break removes this. (Relevant once cross-table transactions land — M6 / v1.1 — but the invariant is stated globally, so it must be unambiguous now.)

**Rules that follow from this order:**

- Regular writes on partitioned tables: pkDirectory lock → shard lock(s). Never the reverse.
- Transactions that touch one or more partitioned tables: acquire all involved pkDirectories in ascending table index order, then all involved shards in lexicographic `(table index, shard index)` order, then WAL. Never acquire a shard before a pkDirectory for the same table.
- Non-partitioned tables have no pkDirectory, so they follow: shard lock(s) → walMu.
- Table schema is read-only after `Open()`. If future runtime schema changes are added, a schema lock must be acquired before all of the above.
- **The M7 checkpoint write-barrier sits at the very top of this order.** The consistent-cut checkpoint (see *Roadmap → M7*) pauses all writes via a global barrier; model it as an RWMutex where every write path takes the barrier in *read* mode before acquiring any pkDirectory/shard/WAL lock, and the checkpoint takes it in *write* mode. Because it is acquired before everything else, it cannot deadlock against the write path. Omitting it from the documented order is how a "pause all writes" barrier silently becomes a lock-order violation once it is implemented.

### Primary key — UUIDv7, enforced

Every table has exactly one primary key column. Its type is always UUIDv7 — a 128-bit, time-ordered UUID. This is not configurable.

**Why enforce it:**

- **Client-side generation** — the caller generates the ID before the insert; no roundtrip to hazedb for a sequence number
- **`ORDER BY id` ≈ temporal order at millisecond granularity** — UUIDv7's high 48 bits are a unix-ms timestamp, so IDs sort by creation time *across* milliseconds. **Within a single millisecond the order is not guaranteed** unless the generator implements RFC 9562 monotonicity (a sub-ms counter in `rand_a`); a plain random-fill UUIDv7 sorts randomly inside the same ms. For strict feed order, either mandate a monotonic UUIDv7 generator or order by an explicit sequence column — which is exactly what the tail index's `seqs` provides. Do not rely on `ORDER BY id` alone for exact within-ms ordering.
- **WAL merge is collision-safe in practice** — UUIDv7 carries 74 bits of randomness; the birthday-bound collision probability across billions of IDs is negligible. We accept this residual theoretical risk in exchange for coordination-free client-side generation
- **Engine stays simple** — the PK type is always UUID, so the runtime engine never needs an `any` PK or a per-table type switch; lookups are uniform `map[UUID]uint64`

**Auto-generation:** if the INSERT omits the PK column, hazedb generates a UUIDv7. If the caller supplies one, hazedb accepts it as-is. In both cases the concrete UUID is written to the WAL record before execution — the WAL never contains a bare INSERT without an explicit PK column, because replay must regenerate the exact same row under the exact same ID.

**Migration from an existing database with a different PK scheme:** write a transfer script, insert rows into hazedb (which generates new UUIDv7 PKs), and store the original key as a regular column (e.g. `external_id`). hazedb provides no migration tooling — this is intentionally the caller's responsibility.

### Ordered index (tail-scan path)

Only valid on tables with a `PartitionKey` declared. There is **one `partitionIndex` per partition value**, held in the owning shard's `tails map[PartitionValue]*partitionIndex` (see *Partitioned table* above). Because all rows for a given partition value live in one shard, that index's `rowIDs` point unambiguously into that shard's arena — no `(shardID, rowID)` pairs needed. A scan resolves `PartitionKey value → shard → tails[value]` and walks only that partition value's `seqs`/`rowIDs`, so rows from other partition values that happen to share the shard are never mixed in.

```go
type partitionIndex struct {
    seqs   []int64   // ordered by this column's value, for ONE partition value
    rowIDs []uint64  // parallel pointers into the owning shard's shared arena
}
```

Monotone-append (chat/log) is O(1). Out-of-order is O(N) slice-shift.

**rowID is `uint64`, not `uint32` — overflow is a real hazard otherwise.** RowIDs are monotonic indices into an append-only arena that includes tombstone slots and never shrinks before a snapshot/restart (M7, the last milestone). A `uint32` caps a shard at ~4.29 billion slots *ever allocated*, tombstones included. A hot or skewed shard under high insert/churn can reach that within a single long-running process — at the benchmarked 690k inserts/s concentrated on one shard, in well under two hours — and `uint32` wraparound is silent: a reused rowID aliases a different live row, so reads and updates corrupt unrelated data with no error. `uint64` removes the practical ceiling (the arena hits RAM limits long first). If `uint32` is kept for memory reasons, the allocator **must** hard-detect approaching `MaxUint32` and force a compaction/snapshot-restart before wraparound rather than silently wrapping.

### Byte capacity and store stats (`MaxBytes`, `/meta`)

Every shard keeps a running **byte tally** of its live rows, maintained under the shard lock by every insert/delete/update — never a walk. A row's cost (`rowCost`) is the sum of its cells' in-RAM footprint (the 32-byte `Value` plus any string/bytes backing) plus a fixed per-row overhead and a flat per-secondary-index charge; the payload term is exact, the overheads are modelled constants biased slightly high. That tally is the O(1) source two features read.

**Store stats.** `MetaSnapshot` — HTTP `GET /meta`, PHP `hazedb_meta`, both emitting the same JSON — reports the table count, the configured `MaxBytes`, store-wide `total_rows` / `total_approx_bytes` / `total_tombstones`, and per table its row / column / secondary-index counts, `approx_bytes`, and `tombstones`. It reads the per-shard tallies under a brief RLock — O(shards), independent of row count — so a dashboard hit stays cheap on a large store. The sizes are estimates (exact payload + modelled overhead), not byte-exact accounting.

**Tombstones are not reclaimed in a running process** (known limitation). A delete nils the arena slot and drops the PK from the pkMap/pkDirectory, but the slot is never reused and — on a partitioned table — the dead `rowID` lingers in that partition's `tails` scan list, so `scanPartition` walks every row ever inserted, not just the live ones. Only a restart-from-checkpoint compacts. On a heavy insert+delete workload (the queue shape partitioned tables target) the arena, the tails lists, and scan cost grow until that restart. `tombstones` / (`rows` + `tombstones`) from `/meta` is the visibility into it; a cheap mitigation (prune a partition's `tails` past a dead-fraction threshold, without moving live rows) and eventual arena compaction are open.

**Byte cap.** `Options.MaxBytes` (Caddyfile `max_bytes`) bounds the store's approximate RAM. A db-wide `byteBudget` holds the live total — the sum of the per-shard tallies — and every INSERT **reserves** its `rowCost` against it before the WAL append; a reservation that would push the total past `MaxBytes` is rejected with `ErrCapacity` (HTTP **507 Insufficient Storage**, PHP **-1**), applying nothing. Deletes release and size-changing UPDATEs adjust the total. **The store never auto-evicts** — there is no LRU; the caller frees space with `DELETE` / `DROP TABLE`. This matches the in-memory stance (the source of truth lives elsewhere): a full store fails the write loudly rather than silently dropping data.

`MaxBytes == 0` (the default) is unlimited, and the hot path then pays only one predictable branch — the accounting cost lands solely on deployments that opt into a cap. When enabled it costs one atomic op per insert on the shared counter (measured ~+11 ns on the cheapest concurrent client-PK insert; heavier paths amortise it). `reserve` adds-then-backs-out rather than CAS-looping: the ceiling is **never exceeded**, but two inserts racing the last free bytes can both back out and both reject, leaving a little headroom briefly unused — conservative, never the reverse. An UPDATE that **grows** a row is accounted but not itself gated (only inserts reserve); a grow can push the total over `MaxBytes`, after which inserts are rejected until space frees — a known edge, not a leak (the total stays accurate).

### WAL — format (logical typed-mutation)

hazedb uses a **logical typed-mutation WAL**: each record stores the resolved *operation* — op kind, target table, and the concrete typed parameters that were applied — not the SQL text and not physical page/row-image bytes. It is *logical* in that replay re-applies the mutation through the store's apply path (so it survives storage-layout changes and carries transaction grouping + checkpoint markers), but it is **not** the SQL-string form used by Redis AOF or statement-based binlog.

> **The SQL-string form was benchmarked against this and rejected** (spike preserved in [`wal_format_spike_test.go`](wal_format_spike_test.go)). Carrying the SQL text per record cost **+50% bytes on insert, +37% on a narrow update, +69% on a wide update, 2.5× on delete**, and **~2× replay time with more allocations** (every record re-runs prepare + the eval pipeline). Its only plausible advantage — a human/replication-friendly log — is largely illusory: the envelope is binary-framed with CRC regardless, and consumers already need the exact schema + UUID + transaction semantics to replay it. Typed-mutation keeps every architectural benefit of "logical" without the parser tax. See *Settled decisions* and the changelog (rev. 7).

**Record envelope.** A single mutation body is not enough: the WAL must also carry grouped transactions (multiple mutations committed atomically) and checkpoint markers, and recovery must be able to tell records apart. Every record is therefore wrapped in a typed, versioned, self-delimiting envelope. **All multi-byte integers are little-endian, fixed.**

```
Envelope: magic:2 | type:1 | version:1 | length:4 | payload:length | crc32c:4
          // crc32c (Castagnoli) computed over magic|type|version|length|payload
          // type: 1=MUTATION  2=TXN  3=CHECKPOINT
          // length bounds-checked against bytes-remaining before payload is read

MUTATION payload:   op:1 | tableID:2 | op-body
  INSERT op-body:   row            (numCols:2, then a typed cell per column)
  UPDATE op-body:   pk-cell | nsets:2 | (col_ordinal:2 | typed cell) × nsets
  DELETE op-body:   pk-cell
TXN payload:        stmt_count:4 | MUTATION-payload × stmt_count
CHECKPOINT payload: snapshot_path_len:2 | snapshot_path | lsn:8

typed cell:         kind:1 | payload
  Int / Bool:       value:8
  String / Bytes:   len:4 | bytes
  Null:             (kind byte only)
```

The asymmetry between op-bodies is the whole point of the format: INSERT carries the full row (it must), but UPDATE carries only the PK plus the changed columns (not the whole row, as a physical row-image would), which is where the measured size win comes from — a one-column edit on a wide row is 51B here vs 218B for a full row-image.

**Unknown version/type must fail loud, never skip.** (Correcting an earlier draft that said recovery should "skip records it doesn't understand" — that is a silent data-loss bug for a *data* WAL: skipping an unrecognised data record drops a committed mutation and diverges from the true state.) On replay, an envelope whose `version` is newer than the binary understands, or whose `type` is unknown, is a hard error that aborts `Open()` — the operator must use a compatible binary. Skipping is only ever acceptable for record types explicitly defined as optional/advisory (none today; `CHECKPOINT` is recognised-and-skipped only because its effect is already captured by loading the snapshot, not because it is ignorable). This is distinct from *tail* truncation, where a torn/CRC-failing record at the very end is the incomplete tail and is correctly discarded.

**Decoded records are validated before they are applied, not just parsed.** Envelope framing (length, CRC, version/type) is bounds-checked during the read, but a crafted-but-CRC-valid record can still decode to a semantically impossible mutation — an UPDATE ordinal past the table's column count, or an INSERT row whose cell count differs from it (the count is the payload's own `numCols`). Applying those unchecked indexes a `Row` out of range, and replay runs inside `Open()` with no `recover()` — and a slice out-of-range is a panic, so it crash-loops the process on every boot until the WAL is removed (CRC is no defense when the file itself is writable — a shared volume or file swap). So `applyMutation` range-checks every decoded ordinal against the column count and requires the INSERT row to be exactly that wide, failing closed with `ErrWALCorrupt` — the same guard the SQLite drain path applies, kept symmetric between the two consumers of `decodeUpdateMutation` / `decodeRow`.

Parameters are serialised as typed values (UUIDv7, int64, string, bool, bytes, null) — **always the concrete, resolved values that were actually applied**, never the caller's original unresolved arguments. Auto-generated values (the UUIDv7 PK when the caller omits it, any server-side defaults) are resolved before the WAL record is written.

**Input `[]byte` is cloned at the write boundary.** A `[]byte` argument (or a caller-built `Value` carrying one) is deep-copied when it is converted to a stored value, so storage never aliases a slice the caller still holds and could mutate after the call returns — that would corrupt the stored row and diverge it from the already-written WAL record. Strings are immutable and int/bool/UUID are value types, so this applies only to `bytes` columns. (Reads are already detached by the clone-under-lock path; this makes the write side symmetric.)

**Atomicity comes from the envelope, not a separate COMMIT token.** A TXN record is one self-delimiting envelope holding all of the transaction's statements; it is durable iff the whole envelope is present with a valid CRC. A torn or truncated TXN envelope (interrupted mid-write) fails the CRC / length check during tail recovery and is discarded in its entirety — there is no such thing as a half-applied transaction in the WAL. This replaces the earlier "pairs followed by a `COMMIT` marker" framing: the commit boundary is the envelope boundary.

**Execution pipeline for every write (mandatory order — follows global lock ordering):**
1. Resolve all auto-generated values (generate UUIDv7 PK if absent, apply server-side defaults)
2. Determine affected pkDirectory (if table is partitioned) and data shards
3. Acquire pkDirectory write lock (partitioned tables only)
4. Lock all affected data shards in ascending shard index order
5. Validate (PK uniqueness, type checks, any constraints)
6. Append WAL envelope — while holding all locks; **if the append (`bw.Write`) returns an error, abort here, enter the WAL error state, and do not proceed to step 7**
7. Apply mutation to in-memory store (only reached if the append succeeded)
8. Unlock: release shard locks, then pkDirectory lock

**Why locking before WAL write is critical:** without it, two concurrent writers can append their WAL records in one order but have the OS scheduler apply them to RAM in a different order. WAL and RAM diverge. Holding the lock across both step 5 and step 6 ensures WAL order and in-memory application order are identical by construction — the only way to write the WAL record is while you hold the lock that serialises the memory mutation.

**Multi-shard writes:** when the WHERE clause can touch more than one shard (i.e., no PK or PartitionKey constraint that pins a single shard), all affected shards must be locked before the WAL write. For arbitrary WHERE with an unknown shard set, the two safe choices are: lock all table shards simultaneously (guaranteed correct, potential contention spike), or require the caller to wrap the operation in an explicit `db.Transaction()`. The one-shard-at-a-time alternative is unsafe (non-serialisable writes + replay divergence) — see *Transactions → The problem* and *Settled decisions → Multi-shard non-PK writes*.

A bare `INSERT INTO messages (body) VALUES (?)` does not journal any SQL — the WAL record is the resolved INSERT *mutation*: op=INSERT, the table id, and the full row including the generated UUIDv7 PK. The PK is resolved (generated if the caller omitted it) before the record is written, so replay reproduces the exact same row under the exact same id.

A grouped transaction is one `TXN` envelope containing `stmt_count` MUTATION payloads, applied in order on replay. A `TXN` envelope that fails its CRC/length check (torn write) is discarded whole.

**Why typed-mutation — not physical row-image, not SQL-string:**

| | Physical row-image | SQL-string logical | Typed-mutation (chosen) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write size (insert / wide update / delete) | 127B / 218B / 24B | 190B / 86B / 60B | **127B / 51B / 24B** |
| Update payload | full row every time | SQL + pk + changed params | **pk + changed columns only** |
| Replay cost | direct apply (fast) | parse + eval pipeline (~2× slower, +allocs) | **direct apply (fast)** |
| Encode | per-type cell codec | per-type cell codec + SQL copy | **per-type cell codec** |
| Human readable | No | No — binary-framed with typed params + CRC anyway | No — `hazedb dump` reconstructs SQL |
| Cross-version safe | No — breaks on storage format change | survives storage format changes | survives storage format changes (replay through apply path); breaks on schema changes |
| Sync / replication | Hard | consumer needs schema + UUID + txn semantics | same — consumer needs schema + codec + UUID + txn semantics |

Physical and typed-mutation are byte-identical for insert and delete; the difference is the update payload (delta vs full row) and that typed-mutation replays *logically* (through the apply path), enabling snapshots, TXN grouping, and checkpoint markers. SQL-string lost on the two dimensions that matter — write size and replay — without a real simplicity win (see the spike note above).

**Replay:** apply each typed mutation against the store in order, through the apply path — no SQL parse, no re-validation (the values were validated before they were journaled). A mutation in the WAL either applies completely or was never written — no partial row state possible.

**Tail-recovery robustness — validate lengths before trusting them.** Both the envelope `length` and the inner cell lengths (a row's `numCols`, each string/bytes `len`) are unauthenticated integers that must be read *before* the CRC can be verified (you must read `length` bytes to reach the CRC). A crash-truncated or corrupt final record can therefore carry a bogus length. Recovery must bounds-check the envelope `length` against the bytes remaining in the file before reading the payload, and likewise bound each inner cell length against the payload size — otherwise a corrupt tail length causes an over-allocation (OOM) or an out-of-range read/panic. A record whose declared length exceeds what remains, whose `magic` is wrong, or whose CRC fails, is the truncated tail: stop there and truncate the WAL to the last good record. CRC alone does not protect against this, since it sits *after* the length-driven read.

**`hazedb dump <wal-file>`** reconstructs each typed mutation into readable SQL for inspection. Because the WAL stores typed mutations rather than SQL text, this is a small reconstruction step (op + table + params → SQL), not a raw passthrough.

### WAL — durability

`bw.Flush()` calls the OS `write()` syscall, moving data from the Go bufio buffer into the **kernel's page cache**. Without `File.Sync()`, flushed WAL records generally survive a process crash, but are not guaranteed durable across machine restart, kernel panic, filesystem error, or storage failure.

Four practical modes:

| Mode | Process-crash loss window | Power-loss guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| buffered only (`WALFlushInterval < 0`) | until next manual `FlushWAL()` | none |
| **flush every N s** *(default, `WALFlushInterval: 1s`)* | ≤ flush interval | none |
| flush + sync every N s (`WALSync: true`) | ≤ flush interval | ≤ flush interval |
| flush + sync per write (`WALSyncPerWrite: true`) | none | strongest — flush then fsync after every WAL write, under WAL lock |

The ticker-based fsync is amortised — one `f.Sync()` per ticker fire regardless of write volume. At 1 s interval and 690 k/s inserts that is one fsync per 690 k records.

`WALSyncPerWrite` calls `bw.Flush()` then `f.Sync()` after every individual WAL write, both under the same WAL lock. The sequence — write record → flush buffer to OS → sync OS to stable storage — must be atomic with respect to other WAL writers; releasing the lock between Flush and Sync would allow another writer to interleave and leave unsynced data. Error handling is required on both calls: a Flush or Sync failure must be treated as a fatal WAL error (see *WAL error handling* below). This is the only mode with no acknowledged-loss window; it also has the highest per-operation cost and is appropriate when callers need the strongest durability guarantee at the expense of write throughput.

Configured via `Options`:

```go
WALFlushInterval time.Duration  // 0 = safe 1s default; <0 = manual FlushWAL() only
WALSync          bool           // flush then fsync after each ticker fire; default false
WALSyncPerWrite  bool           // flush then fsync after every individual WAL write; default false
```

A background goroutine started in `Open()` wakes every `WALFlushInterval` and, **holding `walMu` for the whole sequence**, flushes and (when `WALSync` is set) syncs. The lock is mandatory, not incidental: `bufio.Writer` is not safe for concurrent use, and writers append records via `bw.Write` under `walMu`, so the ticker must take the same lock before it touches `bw` or `f` — otherwise a concurrent append and flush race on the buffer's internal state and corrupt the WAL. When `WALSyncPerWrite` is set, `bw.Flush()` followed by `f.Sync()` is called inline after each WAL write under the WAL lock, independently of the ticker. The goroutine exits when the DB is closed.

**The sync decision uses a `dirtySinceSync` flag, not `bw.Buffered()`.** It is tempting to skip work when `bw.Buffered() == 0`, but that is wrong for the fsync decision: `bufio.Writer` auto-flushes to the underlying fd whenever its buffer fills, so a large or bursty write can have already pushed data into the kernel page cache while leaving `Buffered() == 0`. If the ticker keyed `f.Sync()` off `Buffered() > 0`, that auto-flushed data would never be synced until some later write happened to leave the buffer non-empty at a tick — so after a quiet period the newest records sit unsynced indefinitely, breaking the "≤ flush interval" power-loss guarantee of `WALSync` mode. Track a `dirtySinceSync bool` set on every `bw.Write` (and on any auto-flush) and cleared only after a successful `f.Sync()`. The ticker flushes if the buffer is non-empty, and syncs if `dirtySinceSync` — independent conditions.

**Interval semantics (implemented).** `WALFlushInterval == 0` selects the safe **1s default** (a zero-value `Options` should not silently disable durability flushing); a **negative** value is manual-only (`FlushWAL()` is the only flush path) and starts no goroutine. `startTicker` only spawns the goroutine for a strictly positive interval, so `time.NewTicker` never sees a non-positive value. (This resolves the earlier draft's contradiction between "default 1s" and "0 = manual": 0 is the default, negative is manual.) The ticker is started **after** WAL replay so it never races the replay reader on the shared file handle, and `close()` is idempotent (`sync.Once`).

**WAL error handling:** if `bw.Write` (the record append), `bw.Flush()`, or `f.Sync()` returns an error — whether from the execution pipeline, the background goroutine, or an inline `WALSyncPerWrite` call — the DB must enter a permanent error state. **The append error matters as much as flush/sync:** `bw.Write` can fail (notably when it triggers an auto-flush of a full buffer whose underlying write to the fd fails), and step 6 of the execution pipeline must check it. If the WAL append fails, the pipeline must abort *before* step 7 — the in-memory mutation is never applied — otherwise RAM holds a change that is not (and may never be) in the WAL, diverging from any replay. In the error state all subsequent write calls return the WAL error immediately without touching in-memory state. Read-only queries may continue (subject to the usual async loss window: already-applied-but-unsynced writes remain visible and will be lost on restart if they were never synced). The error state is not recoverable without closing and reopening the DB (which triggers WAL replay from the last successfully flushed record).

### SQL interpreter (M1+M2 complete)

Parse → plan → execute path:

```
parseSQL(sql) → assignParamIndices → plan() → execSelect/execInsert/...
```

**Statement cache** (`sync.Map` keyed by SQL string) eliminates parse+plan on repeated calls. **It is unbounded.** This is safe only as long as the key space is bounded — i.e. callers parameterise with `?` so the cache key is the query *shape*, not the data. Any path that inlines literal values into the SQL string (`... WHERE id = 'abc-123'`) produces a fresh key per value and grows the map without limit — a quiet memory leak / DoS vector. Enforce "always parameterise" at the API boundary, or bound the cache (LRU) if ad-hoc literal SQL must be allowed.  
**PK fast path** — `WHERE id = ?` is detected at plan time. Non-partitioned tables: FNV-1a(id) → shard → local pk map, one lock, O(1). Partitioned tables: pkDirectory lookup → rowLocation → shard, two locks, O(1). No scan in either case.

Supported today:

```sql
SELECT col_list FROM table [alias]
       [[INNER | LEFT [OUTER] | RIGHT [OUTER]] JOIN table2 [alias] ON a.col = b.col]
       [WHERE expr] [ORDER BY col [DESC]] [LIMIT n] [OFFSET m]
INSERT INTO table (cols) VALUES (vals)
UPDATE table SET col = val [WHERE expr]
DELETE FROM table [WHERE expr]
```

WHERE supports: `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `?` params, literals (int/string/bool/null).

**Expression nesting is bounded (`maxExprDepth` = 256).** The recursive-descent parser recurses on parentheses (`parseAtom` re-entering `parseExpr`) and on chained `NOT`; nothing else nests (`AND`/`OR`/arithmetic chains iterate). Left unbounded, a crafted `WHERE` with ~1–2 MB of nested parens — under the adapter body cap — drives the parser past the goroutine stack limit, and a Go **stack overflow is a fatal error `recover()` cannot catch**: one request kills the process and the in-memory DB, bypassing the Caddy handler's recover, net/http's per-request guard, and the cgo path alike. The parser counts depth at those two recursion points and rejects past 256 with a normal `ErrParse` (→ 400 / PHP -1). 256 is far above any genuine query (real nesting is a handful deep) and far below the overflow point. The guard lives in the parser, so both adapters are covered; and because expression trees originate only from `parseSQL`, it transitively bounds the AST walks (`evalExpr` / `validateExpr` / `assignParamIndices`) too.

**Joins (two-table, equi-join, indexed-only).** `[INNER|LEFT] JOIN t2 ON a.col = b.col` joins two tables on a single equality. The result row is the left table's columns concatenated with the right's; columns are addressed with `table.col` / `alias.col`, and an unqualified name must be unambiguous across the two tables. **Law: the probed (non-driving) join column must be the PK or carry an index** — a join on an unindexed column is rejected (`ErrUnindexedJoin`), never run as an O(A×B) scan. Execution is an indexed nested-loop: scan the driver, probe the other side via its PK map or secondary index (so a join is O(driver) probes). `INNER` drives whichever side keeps the probe indexed; `LEFT`/`RIGHT` (the `OUTER` keyword is optional) drive the preserved side and NULL-pad unmatched rows on the other side, so the *probed* side's join column must be indexed. `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`OFFSET` apply to the joined result; a single-table `WHERE` conjunct on the driving side is pushed down (and fetched via the driver's own index when it is an equality on an indexed column). The driver is materialised before probing (no cross-table lock held), so a join is **per-shard consistent, not point-in-time** — same contract as any multi-shard read. A column counts as "indexed" for the probe if it is the PK, a single-column index, or the **leading column of a composite `ORDERED INDEX`**; and when the probe table carries an `ORDERED INDEX (joinkey, ordercol)`, a probe-side `ORDER BY ordercol` is served by walking that join key's already-sorted sub-range and stopping at `LIMIT` (single-driver), instead of gathering the whole bucket and sorting — turning the headline filtered-feed join from ~1.1× slower than SQLite into ~4× faster.

**Not supported: `FULL OUTER` and `CROSS` (deliberate, not an oversight).** A `CROSS JOIN` is the Cartesian product (every left row × every right row) with no `ON` equality — there is no join column to index, so it is the one join shape that *cannot* satisfy the indexed-only law and cannot be made `O(driver)`. It is excluded by design, not deferred. A `FULL OUTER JOIN` preserves unmatched rows from *both* sides; the indexed nested-loop drives one side and probes the other, so emitting the probed side's unmatched rows would require tracking every probe hit and a second pass over the misses — driving both sides. It is tractable but unbuilt, deferred until a real need appears. (For the SQLite-vs-hazedb sync-checking use case, neither is required — compare per-table by PK instead.) Note both *do* exist in modern SQLite — `CROSS JOIN` always, `FULL OUTER JOIN` since 3.39 (2022) — so this is hazedb's narrower surface, not a shared limitation. Also deferred: N-way (3+ table) joins, non-equi `ON` conditions, covering indexes. (Composite multi-column indexes **are** supported — `ORDERED INDEX (a, b)`, NOT-NULL columns — serving prefix equality and `WHERE a=? ORDER BY b` without a sort; see the SQL layer doc.)

`OFFSET m` skips the first `m` matched rows (in `ORDER BY` order; without `ORDER BY`, in the same undefined scan order `LIMIT` uses) and applies on every read path — PK/index/ordered-walk/scan and the streaming reads. It is the standard fetch-and-skip: a path fetches `m+n` matches (the top-N heap keeps `m+n`) and drops the first `m`, so a large offset still walks that many matches — the usual SQL `OFFSET` cost. `LIMIT m, n` (MySQL short form) is not accepted; use `LIMIT n OFFSET m`.

**Read consistency of multi-shard SELECT (explicit).** A `SELECT` pinned to a single shard — `WHERE id = ?` on a non-partitioned table, or any scan confined to one partition value on a partitioned table — reads under that shard's read lock and is a consistent point-in-time view. A `SELECT` whose `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` spans multiple shards (no PK/PartitionKey pin) does **not** read all shards under a single lock by default: it takes and releases each shard's read lock in turn, so concurrent writes between shard reads mean the assembled result can reflect a mix of moments and may represent no single instant that ever existed. This is the read-side counterpart of the multi-shard write rule. The contract is: **per-shard consistent, not globally point-in-time.** Callers needing a consistent cross-shard snapshot must either pin the query to one shard, or use the consistent path — read-lock all involved shards for the duration of the scan (correct, but an all-shard read-lock contention spike, same tradeoff as multi-shard writes). `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` over a multi-shard scan inherits this: it merges per-shard results that were each consistent only at their own read instant. **And it must gather-then-sort: `LIMIT n` cannot be pushed down to each shard.** A correct multi-shard `ORDER BY col LIMIT n` collects all matching rows (or at least the top-n per shard) from every involved shard, merges, sorts globally, then applies `LIMIT n`. Taking `n` rows *per shard* and concatenating gives wrong results; even taking the per-shard top-n is only valid as an optimisation if each shard is individually sorted on `col` first. Document which mode a given query uses; do not assume snapshot semantics for unpinned scans.

**Arithmetic in `SET` (`balance = balance - ?`) is supported** (M3): the right-hand side of a `SET` may reference a column, evaluated per row against the live value. This is what lets a transaction express read-modify-write without a prior read — the arithmetic is evaluated under the commit locks, so no lost-update window exists.

---

## Query API

**One runtime engine serves every query.** `db.Query()` / `db.Exec()` parse a SQL string once, cache the compiled plan, and re-run it from the cache on every subsequent call. There is no separate "hot path" — this *is* the hot path. The interpreter was measured at roughly 8× SQLite on point reads *without* any code generation, so the engine carries the speed on its own; codegen is not a precondition for performance.

```go
rows, err := db.Query("SELECT body FROM messages WHERE id = ?", id)
// rows is []Row; the plan for this SQL string is parsed once and cached

_, row, err := db.QueryRow("SELECT body FROM messages WHERE id = ?", id)
// row is a single Row (nil if no match) — no []Row result slice is allocated;
// for a PK-pinned lookup this is the leanest read (2 allocs: the row + arg box)

n, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO messages (id, body) VALUES (?, ?)", id, "hello")
// n is rows affected
```

`QueryRow` returns the first matching row without the `[]Row` slice `Query` allocates; for a PK lookup it goes straight through the point-read path. For an unpinned query it returns the first row of the scan, so add `LIMIT 1`.

### Prepared statements

`db.Prepare(sql)` compiles a SQL string to a plan once and returns a `*Stmt` that holds it, skipping the per-call statement-cache lookup (no SQL-string hash) that the bare `Query`/`Exec` path pays. The handle rebinds its plan automatically if a `CREATE`/`DROP` changes the catalog after `Prepare` (one atomic load + version compare on the hot path), and is safe for concurrent use.

```go
st, _ := db.Prepare("SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE id = ?")
cols, rows, err := st.Query(args...)      // mirrors db.Query
_, row, err := st.QueryRow(args...)       // mirrors db.QueryRow

// Zero-allocation point-read fast path:
dst := make([]Value, 0, 4)                // caller-owned buffer, reused
out, found, err := st.QueryRowByPK(id, dst)
```

`QueryRowByPK` is the hot-read fast path the in-process cgo/FrankenPHP front wants: the key is a typed `UUID` (no interface boxing) and the projected cells are written into a caller-owned, reused buffer (no result clone), so a projection without `BYTES` columns **allocates nothing**. `BYTES` cells are cloned to honour storage's no-alias guarantee; a non-PK-pinned statement is rejected as misuse.

The win is the typed argument plus the scan-into buffer, not the handle alone. Measured against `db.QueryRow` (point read, go1.25):

| Path | ns/op | allocs |
|---|---|---|
| `db.QueryRow` (baseline) | ~87 | 2 |
| `Stmt.QueryRow` (handle, `...any`) | ~82 | 2 |
| `Stmt.QueryRowByPK` (typed + scan-into) | ~36 | **0** |

The handle alone saves only the statement-cache hash (~6%); `QueryRowByPK` nearly halves the point read and removes every engine-side allocation. This is the layer that gives a non-Go consumer a stable, allocation-free read without changing the core.

### The gateway — one official entry point

`*DB` is the **single official entry point** — the gateway. Every consumer enters through it: Caddy calls these methods as native Go, and the FrankenPHP/PHP extension reaches them via cgo (`C → exported Go → the same methods`). **There is no second transport** — the PHP path is cgo calling the very same verbs, not a parallel API. This is the key difference from a network-fronted cache: both consumers bottom out in the same in-process Go call.

The gateway verbs are `Open` / `Close` / `FlushWAL` / `Exec` / `Query` / `QueryRow`, plus `Transaction`. Every verb upholds three guarantees, so all consumers inherit them for free rather than re-implementing them per consumer:

- **Validation.** SQL is parsed, planned, and bound to the live catalog (`prepare()`); args are type-coerced (`toValue`). Malformed SQL or args fail at the verb, identically for both consumers.
- **Boundary clone.** `[]byte`/`Value` args are deep-copied on the way in, so storage never aliases caller memory; returned rows are deep-cloned on the way out, so callers may retain them past later writes.
- **No bypass.** The storage types (`table`, `shard`, `catalog`, `wal`) are unexported, so no consumer can reach storage around the validated verbs.

**Boundary rule.** Database semantics live behind the gateway (the core package). Cross-cutting concerns — auth, tenancy, logging, and the PHP↔Go marshalling the extension needs — live in the consumer/adapter, which then calls the same verbs. The cgo extension is therefore a *translation layer* (PHP zvals ↔ Go `Value`, result-set marshalling), not a second API surface; Caddy needs none of that translation and calls the verbs directly. Consumer-specific concerns never move into the core.

This is why hazedb has **no separate `Gateway` type** the way a multi-transport cache does: with one transport, `*DB` already *is* the gateway. A second public type would only restate what `*DB`'s exported surface already guarantees.

### Output boundaries — Go-native vs protocol (deferred, to build on later)

A design thread worth recording before it's built, because "gateway" hides two different boundaries:

**db.go is the Go API boundary.** It returns Go types — `[]string`, `[]Row`, `Value`, `UUID`, `error`. A Go consumer (Caddy serving hazedb directly) handles those natively and needs nothing more. *Caddy-as-Go is not a special case* — it only needs encoding when it writes an HTTP wire response, at which point it's just another wire consumer.

**A non-Go consumer needs a protocol boundary** — Go `Value`s turned into bytes a caller can read stably. That is real code that has to live somewhere, but it is *not* a new layer between Go and the engine: it sits **beside** db.go, calls the same gateway verbs, and encodes their results. The engine never learns it exists. Deferred shape (small package, function-level, not a service — only when the first non-Go consumer lands):

```
bridge/            // protocol/encoding boundary — portable, shared by wire consumers
  EncodeRowsJSON
  EncodeRowsMsgPack
  DecodeParams
  MapError
```

So there are **three** things, not two:

1. **db.go** — the Go API boundary (gateway). Shared by every consumer.
2. **`bridge/`** — portable encoders (JSON/MsgPack). Shared by *wire* consumers (HTTP responses, Node over a socket, debug). Deferred.
3. **The PHP extension's `Value` → zval translation** — PHP-specific (depends on PHP headers), therefore *unshareable*; it lives in the extension, not in `bridge/`.

**Open, bench-decided question:** what format the *fast* FrankenPHP path uses. hazedb's whole pitch is in-process cgo with no serialization roundtrip, so JSON on that path may reintroduce exactly the cost the architecture removes — the maximal-speed alternative is `Value` → zval directly in the extension (item 3). The cgo section below currently defaults to JSON-with-optional-skip; whether that is fast *enough* relative to the ~200 ns cgo crossing is a `build.sh` + `bench.sh` measurement, not an assumption. `bridge/` is useful for the portable consumers either way; the question only governs whether the PHP fast path routes through it or goes zval-direct.

The `Value` accessors (`Str`/`Int`/`Bytes`/`UUID`) are already the stable read surface all of the above build on — a JSON encoder and a zval translator are both just "loop rows, switch on `Kind`, call the accessor." The encoding sits on top of that surface; it is not a second safety layer.

### Prepared plans and the catalog version

The engine memoises `SQL string → *plan` in a `sync.Map`. A plan never parses its SQL twice. Each cached plan is stamped with the **catalog version** it was bound against (see *Runtime catalog* below); on the next call the engine compares that stamp to the live catalog and:

- **match** → reuse the cached plan directly (the common case — no parse, no re-bind),
- **mismatch** → a `CREATE`/`DROP` has happened since, so re-parse and re-bind against the current catalog before running.

This keeps a cached plan from ever pointing at a table that has since been dropped or replaced: after a `DROP`, the re-bind resolves the now-missing table and the call returns `ErrUnknownTable` cleanly, rather than dereferencing stale storage. Because the catalog version is monotonic and never reused, a stale stamp is always detected.

The PK fast path (`WHERE id = ?` → one shard, O(1) map lookup) and the indexed partition scan (`WHERE partkey = ?`) are both properties of the compiled plan, so a runtime-created table reaches them exactly like a predeclared one — runtime tables are not second-class.

### Optional typed-struct wrapper (post-1.0, not a speed mechanism)

The engine returns `[]Row` (a `[]Value` tagged union). Callers who want typed Go structs instead of pulling fields out of `Value` cells can, post-1.0, layer a thin generated wrapper on top of the *same* prepared plans:

```go
// optional, generated from a declared query — ergonomics only:
type MessageBodyRow struct{ Body string }
func (q *Queries) SelectBodyByMessageID(id UUID) ([]MessageBodyRow, error)
```

The wrapper calls the identical executor and copies each `Row` into the typed struct. It buys **compile-time type safety and nicer call sites**, not throughput — the plan it runs is the one the runtime engine already caches. It is therefore optional, deferred, and explicitly subordinate to the runtime engine: hazedb is fast with codegen absent. (Earlier revisions of this RFC made codegen the hot path and the interpreter a "fallback"; that is inverted — the runtime engine is primary, codegen is an optional ergonomic layer.)

### FrankenPHP / cgo boundary

The primary cgo entry points map straight onto the runtime engine:

```php
hazedb_fetch("SELECT body FROM messages WHERE id = ?", [$id])      // → ['body'=>...] or null
hazedb_exec("INSERT INTO messages (id, body) VALUES (?, ?)", [$id, "hello"])  // → affected count
```

One SQL parse per distinct string (cached thereafter), one cgo crossing per call. Args are a native PHP array (PDO-style) and result rows come back as native PHP arrays built via zval trampolines — no JSON crosses the boundary in either direction. See [docs/php-array-bridge.md](docs/php-array-bridge.md) for the full design + benchmarks.

## Runtime catalog and DDL

The set of tables is **live DB state, not a compile-time constant.** `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` are first-class SQL statements that run while the database is serving traffic; the schema does not have to be known at `Open()`. An empty schema is a valid starting point.

### The catalog snapshot

All tables live in an immutable `catalog` value published behind an `atomic.Pointer[catalog]`:

```go
type catalog struct {
    version uint64
    byName  map[string]*tableRT  // name → table
    byID    []*tableRT           // durable tableID → table; a nil slot is a dropped table
}
```

Every read and write loads the pointer **once** at the top of the call and uses that one snapshot for the whole operation — entirely lock-free. DDL never blocks or slows a read/write: it builds a **new** catalog (copying only the small registry maps; existing table storage is shared by pointer, never copied) and swaps the pointer atomically (RCU). An in-flight query keeps its consistent view; the old catalog is GC'd once no call still holds it.

`ddlMu` serialises concurrent `CREATE`/`DROP` against each other. Reads and writes never take it.

### Durable table IDs

Each table has a `tableID` assigned at creation = the current length of `byID`. IDs are **append-only and never reused**: `DROP` nils the `byID` slot but keeps the slice length, so a later `CREATE` of the same name gets a *new* id. This is what makes WAL replay unambiguous — a mutation record carries its `tableID`, and after a drop+recreate the old id's records never collide with the new table.

### Catalog version → plan invalidation

`version` increments on every `CREATE`/`DROP`. It is the stamp the statement cache checks (see *Query API → Prepared plans*): a bump invalidates cached plans lazily, on next use, so a plan can never run against a table that changed under it. DDL being rare, re-binding every cached plan after a schema change is an acceptable cost.

### WAL-logged, replayed before mutations

`CREATE` and `DROP` are journaled to the WAL (`recCreateTable` / `recDropTable`) **before** the new catalog is published — so a crash between the journal and the swap replays to the same state, never a published-but-unlogged table. On `Open()`, replay processes catalog records in order before the mutations that reference them, rebuilding the exact `tableID → table` mapping; runtime-created tables and their rows survive restart. `CREATE` records the full `TableDef` (column types + PK/PartitionKey/Immutable/Nullable flags); a partitioned table created at runtime rebuilds its `pkDirectory` and tail index on replay, identical to a predeclared one.

### v1 limits

- **`CREATE` and `DROP` only — no `ALTER`.** Column add/drop/retype is out of scope for v1; `ALTER` is not even a keyword, so it surfaces as a parse error rather than partial handling. To change a table's shape: `CREATE` the new table, copy rows across, `DROP` the old one.
- **No "DROP while an active cursor holds the table."** This needs no lock: `Query()` fully materialises and deep-clones its result before returning, so there are no streaming cursors aliasing storage. A concurrent `DROP` only unlinks the table from the next catalog; rows already returned to the caller are independent copies, and an in-flight query finishes against the snapshot it loaded.

---

## Transactions and atomicity

### The problem

`UPDATE ... WHERE expr` and `DELETE ... WHERE expr` can touch rows across multiple shards. The naive implementation locks and writes one shard at a time:

```
lock shard 0 → mutate matching rows → unlock
lock shard 1 → mutate matching rows → unlock  ← UNSAFE: see below
...
```

**This pattern is not just a torn-read problem — it is a write-serializability and replay-divergence bug, and it must not be used.** The lock-before-WAL-write invariant (*WAL — format*, step 6) guarantees "WAL order = in-memory apply order by construction" **only when the single lock that serialises the mutation is held across the WAL append**. That holds for single-shard / PK-pinned writes. It does *not* hold once a statement spans shards and releases each shard lock before taking the next.

Concretely, two concurrent multi-shard statements S1 and S2, both touching shards A and B and both writing some row on each:

```
S1 locks A, applies, unlocks A
S2 locks A, applies, unlocks A      // on A: S1 then S2  → A's row = S2
S2 locks B, applies, unlocks B
S1 locks B, applies, unlocks B      // on B: S2 then S1  → B's row = S1
```

Live memory ends at (A=S2, B=S1) — a state with no single serial order. The WAL is a total order via `walMu` (say S1 then S2), so replay applies S1 fully, then S2 fully, ending at (A=S2, **B=S2**). **Post-crash replay diverges from pre-crash memory**, directly violating the "identical by construction" invariant. Even with no crash, the live state is non-serialisable.

The fix is to hold **all** affected shard locks (in ascending shard-index order — see *Lock ordering*) across the single WAL append and all applies, exactly as `db.Transaction()` does. There are therefore only two safe ways to run a multi-shard, non-PK-pinned write:

1. Lock all affected shards simultaneously before the WAL write (guaranteed correct; possible all-shard contention spike), or
2. Require the caller to wrap it in `db.Transaction()`.

The one-shard-at-a-time pattern above is neither and is a bug. See *Settled decisions → Multi-shard non-PK writes* — this is **closed by correctness**, not an open tradeoff: the status quo third option is unsafe and one of the two safe options is mandatory. Multi-shard non-PK `UPDATE`/`DELETE` outside a transaction takes the lock-all-shards path (`updateWhereAll`/`deleteWhereAll`); inside a transaction, statements are PK-pinned by the v1 rule.

**Crash safety (PK-pinned and single-shard writes)** is solved by the logical WAL combined with the lock-before-WAL-write ordering: the resolved statement is appended to the WAL buffer while holding the shard lock that serialises the mutation, and only then applied to memory (still under lock). For these writes WAL order and in-memory application order are identical by construction. Crash mid-execution → the statement is either fully in the WAL (replay re-executes it deterministically) or not in the WAL at all (nothing to replay) — no partial row state is possible. For multi-shard writes the same guarantee holds **only** under option 1 or 2 above.

**What is atomic today:** PK-based operations (`WHERE id = ?`) on non-partitioned tables hit exactly one shard under that shard's lock — fully atomic. On partitioned tables, `WHERE id = ?` acquires pkDirectory lock then shard lock in that fixed order — also fully atomic (no other operation acquires them in reverse order).

**Broad single-statement writes are atomic too.** A predicate `UPDATE`/`DELETE` spanning shards (`updateWhereAll`/`deleteWhereAll`) runs in two passes under all shard locks: collect + validate every matched row's new image, journal the whole batch as **one `TXN` envelope**, then apply. A WAL failure aborts with nothing applied; a crash leaves the whole statement in the WAL or none of it. So such a statement is all-or-nothing, not partially applied. (The single-row-per-WAL-record form it replaced could half-apply on a mid-statement WAL failure.)

**Multi-statement atomicity** is provided by `db.Transaction()` (M6, v1 scope below): a group of PK-pinned statements on one table commits or rolls back together under a single `TXN` WAL envelope. **Still not atomic:** multi-shard `WHERE` operations run *one-shard-at-a-time* (the unsafe pattern — non-serialisable + torn reads; never used), and cross-table or non-PK-pinned statement *groups* (out of v1 transaction scope).

### Design decision — explicit opt-in

Non-transactional operations pay zero overhead. Atomicity is explicit opt-in. No implicit transaction wrapping, no global serialisation for callers that don't need it.

### Go API

```go
// Arithmetic in SET (balance = balance - ?) is evaluated under the commit lock.
// Pre-reading balances outside the transaction creates a lost-update race — do
// not use that pattern.
err := db.Transaction(func(tx *Tx) error {
    if _, err := tx.Exec("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?", 100, fromID); err != nil {
        return err  // propagate → rollback
    }
    if _, err := tx.Exec("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?", 100, toID); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil  // commit; return non-nil = rollback
})
```

**A failed `tx.Exec` poisons the transaction — ignoring the error cannot commit a partial result.** The example checks every `tx.Exec` error, and that is the recommended style, but correctness must not *depend* on the caller doing so. Once any `tx.Exec` returns an error, the `Tx` is marked poisoned: every subsequent `tx.Exec` is a no-op that returns the same sticky error, and at the end `db.Transaction` **forces a rollback and returns that error even if the closure returned `nil`**. Without this, a closure that ignores a failed statement and falls through to `return nil` would commit everything *except* the failed statement — a silent partial transaction. Fatal-on-first-error makes "ignored error" fail safe (whole transaction rolls back) rather than fail open (partial commit).

**How it works internally:**

1. Entering the closure, statements are **not** applied to the live arena, but they are **not** evaluated blind either: each `tx.Exec` evaluates against a per-transaction **staged overlay** layered over the committed store. Statement *N* sees the effects of statements 1…*N*−1 in the same transaction (read-your-writes). The overlay records pending inserts/updates/deletes keyed by `(table, PK)`; reads inside the transaction consult the overlay first, then the live store.
2. `return nil` → determine all affected pkDirectories and data shards (union across all staged mutations, including predicate-evaluation under lock — see *Predicate writes* below); acquire all pkDirectories in ascending table index order; lock all data shards in lexicographic `(table index, shard index)` order (global lock order — deadlock-safe); re-validate the staged set against the now-locked live state (PK conflicts, constraints, types) — and re-evaluate any arithmetic `SET` against the locked live values plus earlier in-transaction effects, so the overlay reflects the true committed-time result; if any validation fails, unlock in reverse and return error — nothing is written to the WAL; write the single `TXN` envelope (commit boundary = envelope boundary; no separate COMMIT token); apply the staged mutations to the live arena in statement order; unlock shards then pkDirectories; return success
3. `return err` → discard the overlay, nothing written, nothing in WAL

**Read-your-writes (required, not optional).** Without the overlay, `INSERT INTO t (id, …) VALUES (X, …); UPDATE t SET … WHERE id = X` would fail or operate on stale state at commit, because the row X does not exist in the committed store until apply time — and two updates to the same row in one transaction would lose the first. The overlay makes intra-transaction reads observe prior intra-transaction writes, which is the SQL contract. The `db.Transaction` transfer example below touches two *different* rows (`fromID`, `toID`) and so does not exercise this path, but the general guarantee must hold. (This is distinct from the lost-update warning about pre-reading *outside* the transaction.)

**Predicate writes — the matching set must be resolved under the commit locks, not frozen at buffer time.** The `(table, PK)` overlay correctly represents pending *effects*, but it cannot pre-freeze *which rows a predicate matches*. For `UPDATE/DELETE … WHERE status = ?`, the set of matching rows can change between the closure body and commit (a concurrent writer flips a row's `status`, or inserts a new matching row). Evaluating the predicate when the statement is first seen and replaying that frozen PK set at commit is a serializability bug — the transaction would touch rows that no longer match and miss rows that now do. Two correct options:

- **Default in v1 — restrict transactions to PK-pinned statements.** Every statement inside `db.Transaction()` must pin its target row(s) by PK (`WHERE id = ?`/`IN (…)`); routing for partitioned tables additionally pins the PartitionKey. The affected shard set is then known up front, no predicate re-evaluation is needed, and contention stays bounded. Non-PK-pinned statements inside a transaction are rejected at plan time.
- **Predicate writes (later) — evaluate under all-shard locks.** If unpinned `WHERE` inside a transaction is supported, the statement's shard set is unknown in advance, so it must lock **all** shards of each table it touches, then evaluate the predicate against the locked live state (plus prior in-transaction effects) and apply. This is correct but reintroduces the all-shard contention spike, which is exactly why it is not the v1 default.

Either way, predicate matching happens under the same locks that protect the apply — never against a stale pre-lock snapshot.

**Read isolation — what a transaction may read, and what is not promised in v1.** The overlay gives *read-your-writes* (a statement sees the transaction's own earlier effects), but it does **not** by itself give isolation against *other* committed transactions. The dangerous pattern is read-compute-write spanning the closure: read value A early, compute something from it in Go, then write B based on it — a concurrent transaction can commit a change to A in between, and because only the *write set* is validated under the commit locks, the stale read of A is never rechecked → lost update / non-serialisable result. v1 closes this by construction rather than by adding optimistic-concurrency machinery:

- **v1 transactions are write-only at the API.** `tx.Exec` only; there is no `tx.Query` that hands committed row data back to the closure for arbitrary computation. The only "reads" are internal: read-your-writes of the transaction's own staged effects, and the read embedded in an arithmetic `SET` (`balance = balance - ?`), which is evaluated against the **locked** live value at commit — so that read is consistent, not a pre-lock snapshot. Read-then-write logic must be expressed as arithmetic `SET`, not as app-side compute over a `tx.Query` result.
- **Arbitrary read-for-compute inside a transaction is not promised in v1.** Supporting it requires tracking the transaction's read set and validating it under the commit locks (abort if any read row changed — optimistic concurrency / SSI), or taking read locks on read rows. Both are deferred; the spec must not imply serialisable read-compute-write until one is implemented.

**Auto-generated PKs resolve at statement-execution time, not at commit.** When a transaction's `INSERT` omits the PK, the UUIDv7 is generated when that statement executes inside the closure (and recorded in the overlay), not deferred to commit. This is required so that (a) a later statement in the same transaction can refer to the row via read-your-writes, and (b) the exact same concrete UUID is what lands in the `TXN` envelope and what replay regenerates-by-reading. Deferring generation to commit would make in-transaction back-references impossible and risk a mismatch between the value the closure observed and the value written to the WAL.

**Why this ordering is critical:** the `TXN` envelope is written only after all mutations have been validated (and predicates resolved) under lock. A committed `TXN` envelope therefore always means the transaction was validated and will apply cleanly on replay. It is never possible for a committed WAL record to represent a transaction that would fail on re-execution. Writing the envelope before validating (the naive order) is wrong — a PK conflict discovered after the WAL write leaves a committed record that was never successfully applied.

WAL replay: a torn or CRC-failing `TXN` envelope is discarded in its entirety (the commit boundary is the envelope boundary). A complete, CRC-valid `TXN` envelope is always safe to replay — it was written only after successful in-memory validation under the relevant locks.

### FrankenPHP / cgo API

A Go closure cannot cross the cgo boundary. `START TRANSACTION` / `COMMIT` as separate calls would work but requires goroutine-local state between calls and four cgo crossings (~200 ns each).

**The array form is strictly better:**

```php
// Arithmetic in SET is evaluated under the commit lock.
// Pre-reading balances outside the transaction creates a lost-update race.
hazedb_exec_transaction([
    ["UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?", [100, $fromID]],
    ["UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?", [100, $toID]],
])
```

- One cgo crossing instead of four
- No goroutine-local state between calls — pure function, input in, result out
- If PHP crashes before the call: the call never happened, no leaked state to clean up

On the Go side this maps directly onto the closure API:

```go
func hazedb_exec_transaction(stmts []Statement) error {
    return db.Transaction(func(tx *Tx) error {
        for _, s := range stmts {
            if _, err := tx.Exec(s.SQL, s.Params...); err != nil {
                return err
            }
        }
        return nil
    })
}
```

### Multi-statement transactions at runtime

A transaction is a Go closure (`db.Transaction(func(tx) {...})`, M6) that issues several statements which commit atomically. Each statement runs through the same runtime engine and its cached plan — the SQL is parsed once per distinct string, not per call, so there is no per-transaction parse cost to "compile away." Locking, WAL write, and commit execute at runtime under one `TXN` envelope.

An optional generated wrapper (post-1.0) could expose a fixed transaction as one typed function — e.g. `TransferBalance(fromID, toID, amount)` calling the same cached plans — for caller ergonomics and one cgo crossing. It is a convenience layer, not a performance requirement.

### What this does not cover

Cross-table transactions (debit one table, credit another) require locking shards across two tables. The locking order must be globally consistent (table index ascending, then shard index ascending within each table) to remain deadlock-safe. Deferred to v1.1+.

## Measured benchmarks

> **Scope:** the *Point operations* table below — **all** columns, hazedb and SQLite/Bolt — was re-measured at rev. 23 under **go1.25**, on top of the fold shard-hash and the prepared-statement path. The *Parallel* / *Durability* / *Mixed* sub-tables are still from earlier sweeps (those paths are unchanged or only get faster, so treat them as conservative). These are the runtime engine itself (no code generation); it runs ~18× SQLite `:memory:` on point reads. All on AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (32 threads), Docker, go1.25; absolute µs are load-sensitive on this dev box, so read them as ratios, not an SLA.

### Point operations vs SQLite and Bolt (single-thread, fair 16-byte UUID keys)

All four stores key by the same 16-byte UUID, so the comparison is fair on key width. SQLite appears twice: `:memory:` (RAM, no disk — the like-for-like in-memory comparison) and on-disk (WAL journal).

| Operation | hazedb (mem) | hazedb (+WAL) | SQLite (mem) | SQLite (disk) | Bolt |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| INSERT | **0.38 µs** | 0.50 µs | 1.8 µs | 22 µs | 4 100 µs † |
| SELECT WHERE id=? | **0.11 µs** (`QueryRow` 0.087, `QueryRowByPK` 0.036) | — | 2.0 µs | 3.0 µs | 0.52 µs |
| UPDATE WHERE id=? | **0.085 µs** | — | 1.07 µs | 2.9 µs | 1 480 µs † |
| DELETE WHERE id=? | **0.30 µs** | — | — | ~45 µs | 4 100 µs † |

**Even RAM-vs-RAM, hazedb leads:** vs SQLite `:memory:` it is ~18× on reads (~23× via `QueryRow`, ~55× via the zero-alloc `QueryRowByPK`), ~4.7× on inserts, ~12× on updates. Allocations per op are 1 (update/delete), 2 (insert, or point read via `QueryRow`), 3 (point read via `Query`), 4 (range scan), and **0 via the prepared `QueryRowByPK`** (typed key + scan-into buffer); bytes/op roughly halved by the packed 32-byte `Value` (below).

**What the gap is — and isn't.** It is mostly the Go *access layer*, and it is **not** the cgo crossing. Evidence: swapping the cgo driver for **pure-Go SQLite** (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no cgo, same `database/sql`) made it *slower*, not faster — read **4.1 µs**, insert **15.3 µs**, update **3.4 µs** vs the cgo build's 2.0 / 1.8 / 1.1 µs. So removing cgo costs speed; the crossing was never the bottleneck. What a Go program actually pays to use SQLite is the `database/sql` layer (reflection, interface conversions, ~24 allocations per read vs hazedb's 3, or 0 via `QueryRowByPK`) on top of a general-purpose engine. hazedb is faster because it skips that layer — typed rows returned in-process, no SQL dispatch per call — which is the project thesis, **not** a claim that its lookup beats SQLite's B-tree. † Write rows for SQLite-disk and Bolt are **not** like-for-like on durability (they fsync/journal to disk; hazedb-mem does not). Allocations/op: hazedb 0–4, SQLite 8–24, Bolt 50–66.

### Transactions (single-table, v1)

| Operation | Time | Allocs |
|---|---:|---:|
| 2-row transfer — `db.Transaction` with two PK-pinned arithmetic UPDATEs | **~1.1 µs** | 19 |

Commit locks only the shards the staged statements touch (not all shards) and writes one `TXN` WAL envelope; ~2× a bare PK update, the price of atomicity + the staged overlay. See *Transactions*.

### Parallel scaling (32 cores)

| Operation | Single | Parallel |
|---|---:|---:|
| SELECT WHERE id=? | 0.15 µs | **0.06 µs** |
| INSERT (memory) | 0.42 µs | **0.10 µs** |
| UPDATE WHERE id=? | 0.11 µs | **0.04 µs** |

### Durability ladder — INSERT (relative; overlay FS, not a real-disk fsync SLA)

| Mode | INSERT |
|---|---:|
| flush only (default ticker) | 0.62 µs |
| flush + fsync on ticker (`WALSync`) | ~1.05 µs |
| flush + fsync every write (`WALSyncPerWrite`) | ~1 650 µs |

### Indexed partition scan, and the LIMIT short-circuit

A feed query `SELECT … WHERE partitionkey=? ORDER BY seq DESC LIMIT n` reads only the matching partition's rows — O(partition), not O(table):

| Scan | Time | Allocs |
|---|---:|---:|
| One partition (~120 rows) of a 10k-row table, `ORDER BY … LIMIT 10` | **~11.6 µs** | 124 |

The partition index earns its keep when `ORDER BY` forces examining the whole matching set. An `ORDER BY … LIMIT n` keeps only the running top-n (a bounded heap, cloning a row only when it makes the cut) and sorts just those n, instead of cloning + sorting every match — ~2× faster on the feed query above; the clone savings grow when the scan order is not adversarial to the sort order. **Without `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` now short-circuits the scan** (stop at the limit, project under the lock): an unindexed `SELECT id FROM users WHERE age > ? LIMIT 10` over 10k rows (≈4 900 match) is **~0.6 µs / 4 allocs** — versus **~770 µs / 4 932 allocs before the pushdown** (rev. 12), which cloned every matching row before truncating. So the index matters for ordered tail scans; for an unordered `LIMIT`, the short-circuit already makes a full scan cheap.

### Mixed workload — 4 writers + 16 readers, 2 s, WAL on

*Not re-measured at rev. 12; these predate the read-path fast path, so the read percentiles are if anything conservative.*

| | Value |
|---|---:|
| Insert throughput | 0.72 M/sec |
| Read throughput | 7.0 M/sec |
| SELECT WHERE id=? p50 | 0.70 µs |
| SELECT WHERE id=? p90 | 1.3 µs |
| SELECT WHERE id=? p99 | **17 µs** |
| SELECT WHERE id=? p99.9 | 259 µs |

## Open decisions

| # | Question | Default if left open |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Out-of-order seq policy | Accept O(N) shift, document |
| 2 | walMu contention ceiling | Single mutex until parallel-WAL benchmark demands change |
| 3 | pkDirectory mutex strategy for partitioned tables | Single `sync.RWMutex` until a contention benchmark shows it is the bottleneck; then shard by FNV-1a(UUID top bits) |

**Settled decisions (not revisitable without good reason):**

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| PK type | UUIDv7, enforced, auto-generated if omitted |
| Shard routing | By `PartitionKey` if declared; by PK hash otherwise |
| Tail index rowID ambiguity | Solved by PartitionKey sharding — all rows for a partition value in one shard; `(shardID, rowID)` pairs rejected |
| pkDirectory for partitioned tables | Required from day one — not deferred. Enforces table-wide PK uniqueness and enables O(1) `WHERE id = ?` without scanning all shards. PK and PartitionKey columns are immutable (enforced at plan time). |
| WAL format | Logical **typed-mutation**: op + tableID + resolved typed params per record (full row on insert; PK + changed-column deltas on update; PK on delete). **NOT SQL-string** — benchmarked and rejected (SQL text cost +50% bytes/insert, 2.5× bytes/delete, ~2× replay; spike in `wal_format_spike_test.go`). All auto-generated values resolved before write; deterministic replay via the apply path; `hazedb dump` reconstructs SQL for inspection. |
| WAL durability default | async-bufio + ticker (1 s), fsync opt-in via `WALSync bool` |
| Public API | One runtime engine: `db.Query()`/`db.Exec()` parse once, cache the plan per SQL string, re-bind on catalog-version change. This is the hot path (~9× SQLite on point reads, without codegen). An optional typed-struct wrapper over the same plans is post-1.0 ergonomics, not a speed mechanism. |
| Schema lifecycle | `CREATE`/`DROP TABLE` at runtime over an atomic catalog (RCU); durable append-only table IDs; no `ALTER` in v1 |
| Multi-shard non-PK writes | Closed by correctness, not preference. The one-shard-at-a-time pattern is a write-serializability + replay-divergence bug (see *Transactions — The problem*). A multi-shard `UPDATE`/`DELETE` not pinned to a single shard by PK/PartitionKey must either lock all affected shards before the WAL write, or be wrapped in `db.Transaction()` (M6, shipped). Outside a transaction such statements take the lock-all-shards path; inside one, the v1 rule requires PK-pinned statements. |

**M7 note:** the snapshot IS a logical WAL file — a series of INSERT *mutations* (typed-mutation records, not SQL text) for every live row at a known WAL position. Loading it produces a fresh arena with no tombstones. No special arena compaction code is needed: tombstones accumulate in active memory until a snapshot restart or live reload; once the snapshot loads, the arena starts clean.

**Consistent cut is required.** If writes continue during the dump, the snapshot can contain rows that are also replayed after the checkpoint, miss rows that belong before it, or represent a row combination that never existed simultaneously. The correct protocol is: briefly pause all writes (global write barrier) → record the current global LSN → dump all live rows → write `CHECKPOINT <file> <lsn>` → resume writes. On restart: load snapshot, then replay WAL from LSN onward (resolving the global LSN to a `(segment, offset)` by segment-base comparison). Without the write barrier, checkpoint recovery is not reliable.

**Durability ordering of the checkpoint itself is also load-bearing.** The `CHECKPOINT <file> <lsn>` marker must not become durable, and pre-checkpoint segments must not be deleted, until the snapshot file is actually on stable storage. The required order is: dump snapshot → `fsync` the snapshot file **and** `fsync` its containing directory (so the new file's directory entry survives power loss) → only then write and flush/sync the `CHECKPOINT` marker → only then delete pre-checkpoint segments. If the marker is made durable (or old segments deleted) before the snapshot is fsync'd, a crash can leave a committed checkpoint pointing at a snapshot that is absent or partial, with the WAL prefix it depended on already gone — unrecoverable. The same directory-fsync requirement applies whenever a new WAL segment file is created, not just for snapshots.

**LSN semantics must be pinned down (off-by-one otherwise).** Define `lsn` as the **exclusive** position of the first WAL record *not* reflected in the snapshot — i.e. the write cursor at the moment the write barrier is taken, before the `CHECKPOINT` marker is appended. Because the barrier guarantees no data records are written between dumping the snapshot and appending the marker, the snapshot reflects exactly everything before `lsn` and the `CHECKPOINT` marker itself is written *at or after* `lsn`. Replay then: (1) read the snapshot to rebuild state as of `lsn`, (2) re-open the WAL and scan **from `lsn` inclusive**, (3) treat any `CHECKPOINT` record encountered during replay as a no-op marker (skip it; it carries no row state), (4) apply every data record from `lsn` onward exactly once. Getting this wrong in either direction is a real bug: an inclusive-vs-exclusive mismatch double-applies or skips the first post-snapshot record, and replaying the `CHECKPOINT` marker as if it were a statement fails. State the offset convention in the marker format and in the replay code comment so both sides agree.

**LSN must be segment-aware (a bare byte offset is ambiguous once the WAL is segmented, M7).** With multiple segment files, "byte offset 4096" does not identify a position — offset *into which segment*? Define the LSN as a **global, monotonically increasing logical offset** across the whole WAL, and give every segment file a header recording its `base` global offset (the global offset of its first byte). An LSN then maps to a physical location by finding the segment with `base ≤ lsn < base + segment_size` and seeking to `lsn − base` within it. Equivalently, store the LSN as an explicit `(segmentID, offsetInSegment)` pair. Either is fine, but it must be one of them: a raw per-file offset in the `CHECKPOINT` marker can, after segment rotation, point recovery at the wrong segment or the wrong place in the right segment. The `lsn:8` field in the `CHECKPOINT` payload is this global logical offset; segment selection during recovery is by segment-base comparison, not by filename ordering alone.

**Records never span a segment boundary; segment headers are outside LSN space.** Two framing rules make segmented recovery simple and unambiguous:

- **No record straddles two segments.** Before appending an envelope that would not fit in the current segment's remaining capacity, rotate to a new segment and write the whole envelope there. Recovery then reads each segment as a self-contained sequence of complete envelopes and never has to stitch a record's bytes across files. (Any trailing free space in a segment is just padding the tail scan stops at.)
- **The segment header does not consume LSN space.** The global LSN counts only the logical record stream, not the per-file framing header. So `lsn − base` is the offset to the first *record* in a segment, and resolving an LSN never lands the reader in the middle of (or at the start of) a segment header. State explicitly whether `base` is the global LSN of the segment's first record (recommended) so the arithmetic is unambiguous on both write and recovery paths.

**Checkpoint discovery at recovery must be explicit — naive one-pass replay is wrong.** The snapshot path and `lsn` live inside a `CHECKPOINT` marker that is itself in the WAL, which creates a chicken-and-egg: you cannot just open the first segment and replay forward, because the records *before* the latest checkpoint are already captured in the snapshot — replaying them re-applies pre-checkpoint history (double-apply, and far slower than necessary), and you also have to find the *newest valid* checkpoint, not the first one. Recovery is therefore explicitly staged:

- **Preferred — a checkpoint manifest.** Maintain a tiny `MANIFEST` file holding the current `{snapshot_path, lsn}` (and the live segment list). It is updated by atomic replace (write `MANIFEST.tmp` → fsync → rename → fsync dir) **after** the snapshot is durable and **before** old segments are deleted. Recovery reads `MANIFEST` first — no WAL scan needed to locate the checkpoint — verifies the named snapshot exists and passes a integrity check (e.g. a length/CRC recorded in the manifest), loads it, then replays WAL data records from `lsn` onward. A torn `MANIFEST.tmp` is ignored; the last good `MANIFEST` always points at a complete checkpoint because of the ordering above.
- **Alternative — explicit two-pass recovery.** Pass 1 scans the WAL **without applying anything**, tracking the highest-LSN `CHECKPOINT` marker whose envelope CRC is valid *and* whose named snapshot verifies. Pass 2 loads that snapshot and replays data records from its `lsn` forward. Slower (a full scan to find the checkpoint) but needs no extra file.

Either way the invariant is: find the latest *verified* checkpoint first, load its snapshot, then replay strictly from its `lsn`. Never apply records below the chosen `lsn`. If no valid checkpoint exists (fresh DB, or all checkpoints fail verification), fall back to replaying the entire WAL from the beginning.

Snapshot also functions as a sync baseline for replication consumers, provided the consumer receives both the snapshot file and the WAL offset it corresponds to.

**Pre-M7 caveat — no log truncation means unbounded WAL and linear recovery time.** Checkpointing is the *only* mechanism that lets the WAL be truncated (delete pre-checkpoint segments) and that bounds recovery work. It is the last milestone (M7). Until it lands, the WAL grows without bound on disk for the life of the process, and — more importantly — **restart replays the entire history from the beginning every time**, so recovery time grows linearly with total writes ever made, not with live data size. For a long-running, write-heavy deployment this is an operational ceiling distinct from the in-memory churn caveat (that one is about RAM; this one is about WAL disk footprint and cold-start time). If long uptimes are expected before M7, either schedule periodic restarts from a freshly exported baseline, or prioritise pulling the snapshot/checkpoint work earlier.

**Deferred to v1.1+:** cross-table transactions, group-commit drainer, skiplist index, blob out-of-line storage, lock-free reads via `atomic.Pointer`.

## Review coverage (invariant × operation sweep)

Each mechanism was checked against every operation that can touch it — insert, single-shard read, multi-shard read, PK update/delete, predicate update/delete, transaction, WAL append, flush/sync, tail recovery, replay, checkpoint, snapshot-load — under concurrency and under crash-at-each-step. Status: **safe** (holds as written), **§** (addressed, see section), **open** (documented limitation or deferred). This table is the audit trail for what has been examined; anything not listed has *not* been swept and should be treated as unreviewed.

**Not yet swept (flagged for a future pass):** backpressure when `walMu` or the fsync path cannot keep up with writers (does append block, drop, or error?); behaviour of a *failed* replay/`Open()` (partially-applied state vs clean abort); `Close()` semantics with in-flight writes and a pending flush; clock-regression effects on UUIDv7 monotonic generators; per-value size caps (large blob params vs the `uint32` payload length).
